# Snake-and-ladder-on-FPGA

In this project we have made a snake and ladder game using the dE1-SoC board. The code written is compatible with ARM A9 Cortex processor. We run the program in the Intel FPGA Program. The player will be able to play this game in the terminal of the Intel FPGA Program using buttons in dE-1 SoC to roll the die.
